# Shipping Label Generator

This project is a Python-based tool to generate shipping labels with QR codes and barcodes. It reads data from a CSV file and generates images with the specified labels, QR codes, and barcodes. The project is configurable through an `ini` file, and it includes features like clearing the output folder before generating new labels.

## Features

- Generate QR codes and barcodes for shipping labels.
- Configurable through a `config.ini` file.
- Supports multiline text on labels.
- Automatically clears the output folder if configured.
- Error handling for robust execution.
- Uses generator functions for efficient CSV processing.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shipping-label-generator.git
   cd shipping-label-generator
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

### `config/config.ini`

The configuration file `config/config.ini` should be structured as follows:

```ini
[Paths]
master_shipping_label_image_path = images/master_image.png
font_path = fonts/EBGaramond-Regular.ttf
output_folder = shipping_label_image
csv_file_path = input/data.csv

[Positions]
qr_position = 100,400
barcode_position = 500,400
text_position = 100,600

[Sizes]
qr_size = 128,128
barcode_size = 200,128

[Font]
font_size = 30

[Settings]
clear_output_folder = true
```

- **Paths**: Specifies paths for the master image, font, output folder, and CSV file.
- **Positions**: Specifies positions for the QR code, barcode, and text on the label.
- **Sizes**: Specifies sizes for the QR code and barcode.
- **Font**: Specifies the font size for the text.
- **Settings**: Specifies whether to clear the output folder before generating new labels.

### CSV File

The CSV file (`input/data.csv`) should contain the following columns:

```csv
qr_data,barcode_data,multiline_text
https://example.com,123456789012,"Shipping Label\nOrder #12345\nDeliver to:\n123 Main Street\nCity, Country"
https://anotherexample.com,987654321098,"Shipping Label\nOrder #67890\nDeliver to:\n456 Another Street\nCity, Country"
```

## Usage

1. **Prepare your environment:**
   - Ensure you have the required images and fonts in the specified folders.
   - Ensure the CSV file is properly formatted and placed in the `input` folder.

2. **Run the script:**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Check the output:**
   - Generated shipping labels will be saved in the `shipping_label_image` folder.

## Error Handling

The software includes comprehensive error handling to manage issues such as:
- Missing or malformed configuration settings.
- Missing files or directories.
- Errors during image processing and drawing.
